## Kaweb Shipping Test

This is a small Laravel test based around calculating the minimum required packs of units to complete an order, without going beyond the minimum amount of units required to fulfill the order.

To run this test, please clone and pull this repository down into your root server directory. As this was designed in MAMP, for me this was MAMP/htdocs/.
